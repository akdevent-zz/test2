# Introduction 
  This Microservice provides the functionality to create the order by the user who has
  login into the OMS. 

# Testing 
  We have written a few test cases to test our functionality and also written the negative 
  tests to test our exceptions if they are working or not.

# Entities
  
# Layers Overview 
  We have divided the responsibilities into DAO, Service and Controller layers.

# Exception Handling 
  We have implemented the Exception Handling framework created for the OMS and then implemented our own custom exceptions.

# Logging
  We have implemented the logging framework created for the OMS.
